### Instructions

1. The application renders 15 different development related icons. 

2. Each time a user clicks an icon, they are shuffled in order. The goal of the game is to click each icon, only once. 

3. The application keeps track of the player's score in the nav bar. Each time the player clicks on an icon for the first time in the current round, their score is incremented.

4. If a player clicks on an icon that they've already clicked in the current round, their score is reset to 0 and a message prompts them to play again.

5. With each correct click, the player is shown a corresponding message in the nav bar. A unique message is also shown to the player letting them know when they have won.
